# Input data directory
This is where the input data is going to be.

Represent the file with a name, e.g. `1.{csv,json}`, `batman.{csv,json}`. Then change the `FILE` variable on `main.py` to appropriate value.

## Note
* DO NOT COMMIT THIS DIRECTORY. This is only an initial commit. 
* All the `\*.json` are products generated by `\*.csv`. 
* `5.csv` and `5.json` are the entire dataset, decremental values (eg. `4.csv`, `1.csv`) represent a subset. Check the number of rows of files in a directory using `wc -l ./*`.
