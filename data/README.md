# Input data directory
This is where the input data is going to be.

Represent the file with a name, e.g. '1.{csv,json}', 'batman.{csv,json}'. Then you can use it in `main.py`.

##Note
* DO NOT COMMIT THIS DIRECTORY. This is only an initial commit. All the `\*.json` are generated by `\*.csv`. `5.csv` and `5.json` are the entire dataset, decremental values represent a subset. (check the number of rows using `wc -l ./*`)
